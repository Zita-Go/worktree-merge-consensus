# Worktree Merge Consensus

## Overview

Launch the persistent local coordinator for two-task worktree integration. Keep this skill limited to choosing the tasks and starting the run; the daemon owns the consensus workflow.

## Tool surface

`consensus_doctor` is an MCP tool, not a shell command. The same applies to every `consensus_*` name below. Call these names through the Codex tool interface. Never run `consensus_doctor` as an executable.

Codex starts the bundled MCP server with `codex-consensus mcp-server`. Do not start that foreground process manually during a normal plugin run. The CLI equivalents are:

- `consensus_doctor` → `codex-consensus doctor`
- `consensus_list_threads` → `codex-consensus threads list`
- `consensus_list_worktrees` → `codex-consensus worktrees list --repository <absolute-path>`
- `consensus_start` → `codex-consensus run` with both task IDs and both worktree paths
- `consensus_status` → `codex-consensus status <run-id>`
- `consensus_resume` → `codex-consensus resume <run-id>`
- `consensus_cancel` → `codex-consensus cancel <run-id>`

Use those CLI commands only for diagnostics or when the user explicitly requests the CLI surface. If no `consensus_*` MCP tools are exposed, run `codex mcp list --json`, `command -v codex-consensus`, and `codex-consensus doctor` when shell access is available. Report whether `worktreeMergeConsensus` is absent, disabled, or unable to start, then stop. A successful CLI doctor does not prove that the plugin MCP tools were loaded. Do not search for a `consensus_doctor` binary or substitute ordinary task/thread tools.

## Launch

1. Call `consensus_doctor`. Stop and report its exact error if the binary, plugin surface, Codex App Server, Git, private state, or daemon is unavailable or incompatible. For `LEGACY_SKILL_CONFLICT`, do not delete anything; give the returned migration guidance.
2. Call `consensus_list_threads`. Present all visible tasks and assign two different task IDs as primary and reviewer. A task cwd is display metadata only: do not filter tasks by cwd or infer a source worktree from it.
3. Obtain an absolute `repository_path` to any worktree in the intended repository. Call `consensus_list_worktrees` with that path.
4. Present the registered entries with path, source ref or detached state, full HEAD SHA, and clean state. Assign two different, available, clean worktrees as primary and reviewer sources.
5. Show one complete mapping: `primary_thread` → `primary_worktree`/ref/SHA and `reviewer_thread` → `reviewer_worktree`/ref/SHA. Ask the user to confirm this exact mapping. Do not continue without confirmation.
6. Call `consensus_start` with all four required fields: `primary_thread`, `reviewer_thread`, `primary_worktree`, and `reviewer_worktree`. Include `integration_branch` only when the user supplied a unique new branch name. Include `test_commands` only when the user supplied additional verification commands.
7. Report the returned `run_id` and initial status. State that the result will remain on a new local integration branch and both frozen source refs remain protected. End the launch turn.

The launcher does not conduct or relay review rounds. The persistent coordinator handles contracts, plan revisions, integration, verification, final approval, recovery, and fail-closed pauses.

## Follow-up controls

- Call `consensus_status` when the user asks for progress or the accepted result.
- If `consensus_start` returns `COMMUNICATION_FAILURE` before a `run_id` exists,
  call `consensus_doctor` once; v0.1.7 and later probe and repair the
  daemon-owned App Server proxy. Verify that no run was created, then retry the
  exact confirmed mapping once. If a run ID exists, inspect that run instead of
  creating a replacement.
- Call `consensus_resume` only after the user resolves the reported pause reason.
  For `COMMUNICATION_FAILURE`, explicit user authorization permits the
  coordinator to inspect the exact pending turn. It replaces a terminal
  `failed` or `interrupted` attempt only when canonical history proves that the
  attempt has no side-effectful items; otherwise it remains paused and fails
  closed.
- Call `consensus_cancel` only when the user requests cancellation. Cancellation preserves existing Git state.

Read [references/protocol.md](references/protocol.md) when explaining lifecycle states, acceptance evidence, or recovery behavior.
